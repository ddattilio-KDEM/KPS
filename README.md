# KPS


This project was to create a reviewing tool in a website to review county Emergency Operations Plans (EOP) for the Kansas Department of Emergency management. The website was created to be able to write to a MySQL Database and create an html page that the reviewer can print or save as a pdf. All of the different code files I used are included in this file except the PHP files used to write to the database.
